User Story: Calculate Ideal Weight

As a user of the health calculator
I want to calculate the ideal weight according to the parameters entered
So that I can know the resulting ideal weight.

Accepting Criteria

Scenario: Invalid Height
Given I have an health calculator
When I compute the ideal weight with a negative or 0 height
Then the system raise an exception

Scenario: Invalid Gender
Given I have an health calculator
When  I compute the ideal weight for an invalid gender
Then the system raises an exception


Scenario: Negative Result for Weight 
Given I have an health calculator
When I compute the ideal weight and the result leads to a negative weight
Then the system raise an exception.

Scenario: Valid parameters
Given  I have an health calculator
When I compute the ideal weight for the given valid parameters
Then the system returns a valid result.



User Story: Calculate basalMetabolicRate

As a user of the health calculator
I want to calculate the basal metabolic rate according to the parameters entered
So that I can know the resulting of this health measurement.

Accepting Criteria

Scenario: Invalid Height
Given I have an health calculator
When I compute the  basal metabolic rate  with a negative or 0 height
Then the system raise an exception

Scenario: Invalid Gender
Given I have an health calculator
When  I compute the basal metabolic rate for an invalid gender
Then the system raises an exception

Scenario: Invalid Age
Given I have an health calculator
When  I compute the basal metabolic rate for a negative age
Then the system raises an exception

Scenario: Invalid Weight
Given I have an health calculator
When  I compute the basal metabolic rate for a negative or 0 weight
Then the system raises an exception

Scenario: Negative Result for Weight (only possible for women)
Given I have an health calculator
When I compute the basal metabolic rate for a woman with a combination of height, weight and age that result in a negative weight
Then the system raise an exception.

Scenario: Given valid parameters
Given  I have an health calculator
When I compute the basal metabolic rate for the given valid parameters
Then the system returns a valid result.
